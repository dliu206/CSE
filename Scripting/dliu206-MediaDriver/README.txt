Assignment 2: Media Server

In this folder I've implemented 2 solutions to Media Driver where running the script 1 layer outside of the script folder produces an html file in accordance to the specific Music directory
provided by the starter files.

Running the Python Solution: 
Running dliu206-MediaDriver.py with access to the Music directory will output output.html

Running the bash Solution:
Running ass2.sh with access to the Music directory by writing the following in the command line: ./dliu206-ass2.sh > output2.html
will output input.html


Compare and Contrast
I'm personally more well versed in Python so I had implemented it really quickly.
I used that template to formulate the bash solution and all I had to do was find the syntactical similarities.
Using Python forced me to record and store most of the data to be used later which made for a more easier to solution to craft. It was also way faster than formulating the html file during runtime.
The Bash solution ran slower mostly from the lack of data storage and temporal locality wasn't fast enough. As they said, coding a bash shell script is fast but the execution is slow.
I learned a lot of new functionality and ways to manipulate the output of my shell script code so this was a useful assignment.


Expected Output:
The file directory given in relation to the test output are different beyond a reasonable doubt.
Having said that,
Python solution output will be named output.html
Bash solution output will be named output2.html
and will match with the directory we were given.
