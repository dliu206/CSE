# Scripting

## Descrition 
This 5-credit course explores the role of scripts and scripting languages in the software development cycle.

In contrast to large-scale heavy-weight systems-development languages, scripting languages trade away execution performance and possibly long-term maintainability for shorter development time. Scripts can be light and nimbleâ€”ideal for smaller, ancillary tasks. They are well-suited for one-off tasks and are often effective for rapid prototyping.

The objective of this course is to enrich your knowledge of software development practices using scripting languages to expand your toolkit of problem-solving techniques. Using Bash, Perl, Python, and other languages & utilities, we will explore topics such as job control, pipelines, text processing, regular expressions, unusual/implicit control structures, dictionaries & lists, iterators, generators, closures, and decorators.

While scripting may be light-weight, the subject matter is deeply technical and will be presented at the university level. The material should be challenging. Expect to earn those 5 credits. Plan to spend at least 10-15 hours outside of class per week. Do not leave assignments until the last minute.
